Critical and evidence-based reflections on the paper and your new research question(s). 

* Zyczynska-Clolek and Kolczynska (2021) claim that when controlling at the respondents’ level for ‘cognitive, physical, and psychological functioning’ (Zyczynska-Clolek and Kolczynska, 2021, p.466) and ‘undesirable response styles’ (Zyczynska-Clolek and Kolczynska, 2021, p.466) the younger the interviewer is the stronger the negative effect on the assessment of the respondents’ understanding of survey questions (Zyczynska-Clolek and Kolczynska). This variable is measured on 5-point scale with 5 meaning the interviewer assessed the respondent as understanding the survey questions ‘very often’ (Zyczynska-Clolek and Kolczynska, 2021, p.464) and 1 meaning the interviewer assessed the respondent as understanding the survey questions ‘never’ (Zyczynska-Clolek and Kolczynska, 2021, p.464). 
However, Zyczynska-Clolek and Kolczynska’s (2021) note that ‘the role of cultural differences’ (Zyczynska-Clolek and Kolczynska, 2021, p.473) still ‘remains to be explored’ (Zyczynska-Clolek and Kolczynska, 2021, p.473). Furthermore, previous research suggests there is a link between culture and its’ influence on the perceptions of older people (North and Fiske, 2018). For example, North and Fiske (2018), argued in their research that European cultures respect older people less so than Eastern cultures. This could mean that countries in the European Social Survey (European Social Survey, 2017), that are in West Asia (e.g., Israel (United Nations, 2023)) may have interviewers’ who rate older respondents understanding of survey questions more favourably than those from Europe – hence culture influencing their world view (Burnham, 2006) and therefore, influencing the way they assess respondents. Adding to this, Fernadez-Ballesteres (2020) reported that 90% (2.s.f.) of the European countries they analysed viewed older people as being friendly rather than being competent. They also reported that countries such as Russia and Romania viewed older people as being competent rather than being friendly (Fernadez-Ballesteres, 2020). This potentially suggests that Eastern European countries like Russia/Romina (United Nations, 2023) may also have cultural influences on perceptions of older people and hence may have interviewers’ who rate older respondents understanding of survey questions more favourably than those from the rest of the continent of Europe. Building on this, White, Muthukrishna, and Norenzayan (2021) found that irrespective of religious beliefs countries which are religious are more culturally similar than those who are not. This potentially suggests that religious countries may share a more similar world view (Burnham, 2006) than to those who are not, for example, White, Muthukrishna, and Norenzayn (2021) found that religious countries have greater ties to family than non-religious countries – this could potentially mean that these countries share a more similar perception of the older generation and hence interviewers’ from these countries may share similar biases when assessing respondents. Ewen, Nikzad-Terhune, and Dassel (2020) also found a link between religious beliefs being an indicator for cultural values around aging. They found that most religious societies are likely to have a positive viewpoint of aging with this being increased when the religiosity at both the induvial and societal level is amplified (Ewen, Nikzad-Terhune, and Dassel, 2020). They compared this to western cultures such as the North and West Europe where countries are more likely to be secular (Coutinho, 2016) and found that these countries are more likely to have a negative perception of aging (Ewen, Nikzad-Terhune, and Dassel, 2020). This potentially suggests that countries with similar levels of religiosity have more similar cultures and hence may have more similar world views when it comes to the perceptions of older people and assessing respondents’ ability to understand survey questions. In addition to this, Coutinho (2016) found that countries in West Asia (United Nations, 2023) such as Turkey have the highest levels of religiosity with some countries from the South of Europe also having very high levels of religiosity such as Kosovo. They found that other countries in South and East Europe (e.g., Greece and Romania), also have fairly high levels of religiosity and that the countries with the lowest levels of religiosity were concentrated in Northern Europe (e.g., Sweden) and Sahgal (2018) found that secularisation is also widespread in Western Europe. This therefore, potentially sets the premise for extending Zyczynska-Clolek and Kolczynska’s (2021) claim stated above as there is potentially an argument that cultural similarities measured via religiosity levels of different regions of the countries in the European Social Survey impacts interviewer’s’ world views around perceptions of aging/older people and hence their bias’s when assessing respondents’ ability to understand survey questions. 
Therefore, this replication project aims to explore the role of cultural differences measured via religiosity at the regional level in affecting interviewers’ assessment of respondents’ understanding of survey questions. Note in order to divide the countries involved in the European Social Survey the United Nations geo-scheme was used – dividing the countries in the dataset into: Northern Europe, Southern Europe, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and West Asia (United Nations, 2023). It will do this by assessing the following hypothesis: The lesser the religiosity of a country at the regional level, the stronger the negative effect on the variable which measures the interviewers’ assessment of how well a respondent understood the survey questions. 
This replication project will therefore test the robustness of Zyczynska-Clolek and Kolczynska’s (2021) research paper as this replication project will use the same data used to produce the original results but will use a slightly different method (by adding a religiously variable and grouping countries to create a ‘region level’) to investigate a new hypothesis (Freese and Peterson, 2017). 
This replication project expects to find (as pre-registered): 
•	The lesser the religiosity of a country at the regional level, the stronger the negative effect on the interviewers’ assessment of how well a respondent understood the survey questions.

Briefly summarise, what results you expected to find and preregistered.


## 2. Data and methods

### 2.1. Data

**250 words**

Transparently __describe data__ used in the original paper and in your replication project: full dataset names, years of data collection, sources (who created data), sample sizes, variables used in the model you replicate.

Embed R code to upload your data (recommendation - show code only using `results='hide'` in the chunk options). 

Remember to add all datasets with their doi number to the list of references. See examples in the conditions of use for the ESS data [here](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/data/conditions_of_use.html).

Report all steps you have undertaken in __data transformation__:

* Subsetting data by selecting a lower number of variables or excluding any cases.
* Merging data files.
* Steps in recoding and renaming all variables. 
* Embed R code below to present the steps in data manipulation. If this would be very long chunk of R code (over 1 page), show just some examples and hide the rest of the code in text (`include=FALSE` option). The entire code will be still displayed in Appendix 2. 

You __have to__ display some summary statistics of your key variables of interest. This could be done as a table/s or a graph/s presenting distribution of your dependent variable/s for the entire sample or by a group of interest, boxplots, correlation plots or graphs with means values.


### 2.2. Methods

**250 words**

Describe what methods were used in the original paper and what methods you used and why. 

Support any changes you made in the analytical strategy with literature and/or displaying any relevant data diagnostics. 

If suitable, embed statistical tests comparing model fit of both methods.


## 3. Results

**500 words**

Display and describe your research results.

Show R code and professionally looking outputs, e.g. tables prepared in `tab_model` or `stargazer` functions, or graphs as `coefplots` or predicted values.

Provide in-depth discussion and interpretation of your results.


## 4. Conclusions

**250 words**

Discuss you findings in the light of literature you introduced in the introduction.

Reflect why your results are similar/different from the original study.
